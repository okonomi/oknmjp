			<h1>🧑‍🚀 Hello, Astronaut!</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to the official <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> blog starter template. This
				template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build
				a personal website, blog, or portfolio with Astro.
			</p>
			<p>
				This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your
				<code>astro.config.mjs</code> file. You can customize your setup with
				<a href="https://astro.build/integrations">Astro Integrations</a> to add tools like Tailwind,
				React, or Vue to your project.
			</p>
			<p>Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li>
				<li>Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code></li>
				<li>Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code></li>
				<li>Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/pages/blog/</code></li>
				<li>Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to <a href="https://docs.astro.build/">read the docs
				</a> or <a href="https://astro.build/chat">join us on Discord</a> to ask questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Looking for a blog template with a bit more personality? Check out <a href="https://github.com/Charca/astro-blog-template">astro-blog-template
